excerpt: 'This research discusses traditional machine learning models, the U-Net model and
 the GAN model in image colorization. Image colorization focuses on predicting
 and filling in the missing colors of grayscale images to produce realistic and
 reasonable color images. This task can improve the interpretability and aesthetic
 appeal of historical photographs. We use the Kaggle Image Colorization Dataset
 to train different models, including linear regression, gradient boosting, random
 forest regression, decision tree regression, the U-net model and a Generative
 Adversarial Network (GAN) model. It insights into the effectiveness of different
 machine learning methods in image colorization. Our experiment results indicate
 the traditional machine learning methods predominantly added a single brown color
 to grayscale images and the U-net model can generate limited color. In contrast,
 the GAN model demonstrated better performance in generating more realistic and
 reasonable color images. It can help to restore and enhance the greyscale images.
 In future work, we also plan to use the stable diffusion model and large dataset to
 improve image colorization performance.'
