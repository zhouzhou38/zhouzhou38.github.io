excerpt: 'The real-world social network undertakes an array of complex functions that shape different people's relationships and built diverse relations between individuals. Friendship is very important and common in society. The social network also indicates the small-world effect. Stanley Milgram's experiment[J.Travers, S.Milgram, Sociometry 32, 425-443 (1969)] (1) uses mail to learn more about the probability that two randomly selected people would know each other and attempt to find the average path length between two persons. In general, Breadth-first search (BFS) can find the shortest path between two nodes and this algorithm is an exhaustive method. My algorithm only allows each user to send once to an adjacent user until it reaches the target node or failed. For example, if I want to send a mail to UB President Satish K. Tripathi, which friend I should choose to ensure UB President can receive my mail as soon as possible. To achieve this goal, I hope this letter passed as few times as possible. I use the Facebook dataset (ego-Facebook), which includes every user's friend list, to analyze the relations between node centralities and the path between two nodes. I construct a recursion algorithm to find the path between two nodes following their node centrality. My result indicates that the eigenvector centrality is the best method to deliver mail in my experiment. I also propose 3 types of people with different characteristics for analysis and choose the most suitable centrality to pass mail.'
