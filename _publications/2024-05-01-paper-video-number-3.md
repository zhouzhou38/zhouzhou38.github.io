excerpt: 'The deep learning final competition is video frame prediction and semantic clas
sification. Specifically, this competition needs to use the first 11 images to find
 the 22nd image object class. Every team cannot use any pre-trained model and
 outside dataset. Our team divided this question into two separate questions, an
 image generator question and a semantic classification question. We use JEPA
 encoder and ViViT model to implement the image generator. Then we choose the
 U-net model to implement the object classification and achieve 0.92 IOU score in
 the validation dataset. Finally, our team got 0.24 IOU score in the hidden dataset.'
